Hong Kong Weather Visualization for August 2024

I created an interactive data art visualization project showing Hong Kong's daily weather for August 2024, using Python and Pygame.
The project takes real-world weather data (via an API or CSV file), processes it, and renders a particle system, where each particle represents a day in August.

Features
	•	Particle-based visualization: Each day’s weather (sunny, cloudy, rainy) is represented as a particle with distinct orbit radius, speed, and color.
	•	Color mapping by temperature: Particles use different color tones depending on daily mean temperature.
	•	Interactive effects:
	•	Hover with mouse → highlight particle and show tooltip with date and temperature
	•	Particles scatter slightly when one is hovered
	•	Axis-based layout:
	•	X-axis = dates (Aug 1 – Aug 31)
	•	Y-axis = temperature scale
	•	Collapsible statistics panel: Right-hand panel shows summary (number of sunny / rainy / cloudy days, average / max / min temperature). Click panel title to collapse or expand.

Data Source
	•	Primary: Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) Open Data
	•	Fallback: Open-Meteo API (daily temperature, precipitation, weather code)
	•	Offline option: CSV file (data/hko_2024_08.csv) included for reproducibility.
